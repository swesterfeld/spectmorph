- maybe subharmonic tagging
- we may want to publish spectmorph vs. crossfade results
- why does white noise not sound like white noise?
- panning per note
- configurable midi synth semi tones (i.e jack)
- better spectral subtract [1]
- vibrato could have delay property
- possibly add MPE timbre
- rasberry pi alignment compile error lib/smnoisedecoder.cc

-      __m128 out[(block_size + 2) / 4 + 1];   // SSE alignment (should be done by compiler)
-      float *spectrum = reinterpret_cast <float *> (&out[0]);
+      alignas (16) float spectrum[block_size + 2]; // SSE alignment


insts:
 - tuba
 - double bass
 - flute

new operators:
 - crossfade by midi note -> control (bass-trombone / trumpet inst)
 - tremolo

FILTER:

- remove morph plan ptr from API
__ ui __

- improve layout of property edit
- support property editing for mere-float / mere int
- semitones flag for filter cutoff
- property edit window should scroll
- main window should scroll morph output

__ generic modulation __

- handle XPARAM scaled parameters

__ dsp __

- advanced smoothing (drive, subsampled polynomials)
- try to get old performance from new inner loop
- resampling for the filter
- performance tests
- smoothing should probably be log-scale based
- support LinearSmooth<LinearSmooth::MUL>
- tuning polynomials appear to be incorrect
- remove need_left & need_right, replace by mono/stereo
- move filter processing into live decoder processing (interface LiveDecoderFilter)
_________

smenc:
- move partial pruning step to seperate step to be performed after attack optimization
- merge new-pruning-scaling branch somehow
- implement phase-correct "nearest frame" decoding instead of overlap-adding frames
- compute peak over nearest minimum in dB
- compute peak over local (frame) maximum in dB
- debug performance problems
  => implement downsampling for really low notes
  => use symmetry to speed up optimize_partials
  => make a squared window table (optimize_partials)
- implement sinc interpolation for spectrum phase
- make load() function of SpectMorph::Audio and SpectMorph::WavSet reset state
- optimize memory usage of encoder
- reanalyze residual after first pass
- increase time resolution for residual for low notes
- use NoiseBandPartition class to get faster noise band splitting
- adjust noise bands according to frequency specs

smlive:
- make FFTW integration thread safe
- maybe use integer phase representation (-> less floor()/float->int/int->float cycles)
- SSEified noise generation:
  * use a table of (sin[0] cos[0], .. sin[255] cos[255])
  * load sincos[random] sincos[random+1] and shuffle values together
  * write out result
  * combine loop with apply window
- SSEify render_partial

lag diagrams of note start

documentation:
- update API documentation with new classes (LiveDecoder, GenericIn*)

sminspector:
- figure out why mix_freq is 0 for inspect1 foo.wav

morphing:
- performance: use O(n) loop to associate each freq with the nearest freq of the
  other input -> less search cycles, since we already have the best match freq

lv2:
- could implement ui:showInterface for hosts that don't support X11UI

------------------------------------

[1] encoder: better spectral subtract

Often, partials are not stable within one analysis frame - their amplitude
and/or frequency can change (see claudia-ah|claudia-ih|claudia-oh) - as a
result, the peak can be more wide than a mere windowed sine. The result
is extra noise (for instance claudia-ah-1-84.sm with frame size 20).

The idea of this change is to subtract a slightly wider peak from the
spectrum to compensate for unstable partials. A gaussian peak could be
tried, or sines with different frequency|amplitude variations could be
analyzed.

Noise very close to the partial would normally not be audible anyways, as
it should be masked.
