1.0.0 (-beta3)?:
- update manual
- does mono work well with clap / clap ids?
- LV2 window resizing doesn't work in Ardour7
- debug difference between aurora mac aarch64-apple-darwin23.5.0 + sanitizers and linux
- implement spectral centroid feature
- allow unison audio tests with static phase reset
- experiment with smooth tuning for formant correction to reduce artifacts
- try using smooth (1/3 octave?) formant envelopes to reduce artifacts
- possibly fix -Wexit-time-destructors -Wglobal-constructors clang++ warnings

NEXT RELEASE:
- [maybe] support formant correction for Source
- stereo unison
- experiments for handling freq < 1 in spectral envelope (bass boost)
- portamento could morph while sliding

Other:
- handle XPARAM scaled parameters for modulation
- non-linear modulation mapping
- visual feedback for adsr envelope
- try to get old performance from new inner loop
- could implement UI scaling for macOS
- maybe treat std::sin, std::cos like std::fabs
- maybe subharmonic tagging
- we may want to publish spectmorph vs. crossfade results
- why does white noise not sound like white noise?
- panning per note
- better spectral subtract [1]
- vibrato could have delay property
- possibly add MPE timbre

INTERESTING BRANCHES:
- morph-source-formant-correction: add formant correction to MorphSource

insts:
 - tuba
 - flute

new operators:
 - crossfade by midi note -> control (bass-trombone / trumpet inst)
 - tremolo
 - "wave" table
 - synthetic
_________

smenc:
- move partial pruning step to seperate step to be performed after attack optimization
- merge new-pruning-scaling branch somehow
- implement phase-correct "nearest frame" decoding instead of overlap-adding frames
- compute peak over nearest minimum in dB
- compute peak over local (frame) maximum in dB
- debug performance problems
  => implement downsampling for really low notes
  => use symmetry to speed up optimize_partials
  => make a squared window table (optimize_partials)
- implement sinc interpolation for spectrum phase
- make load() function of SpectMorph::Audio and SpectMorph::WavSet reset state
- optimize memory usage of encoder
- reanalyze residual after first pass
- increase time resolution for residual for low notes
- use NoiseBandPartition class to get faster noise band splitting
- adjust noise bands according to frequency specs

smlive:
- make FFTW integration thread safe
- SSEified noise generation:
  * use a table of (sin[0] cos[0], .. sin[255] cos[255])
  * load sincos[random] sincos[random+1] and shuffle values together
  * write out result
  * combine loop with apply window
- SSEify render_partial

lag diagrams of note start

documentation:
- update API documentation with new classes (LiveDecoder, GenericIn*)

sminspector:
- figure out why mix_freq is 0 for inspect1 foo.wav

morphing:
- performance: use O(n) loop to associate each freq with the nearest freq of the
  other input -> less search cycles, since we already have the best match freq

lv2:
- could implement ui:showInterface for hosts that don't support X11UI

------------------------------------

[1] encoder: better spectral subtract

Often, partials are not stable within one analysis frame - their amplitude
and/or frequency can change (see claudia-ah|claudia-ih|claudia-oh) - as a
result, the peak can be more wide than a mere windowed sine. The result
is extra noise (for instance claudia-ah-1-84.sm with frame size 20).

The idea of this change is to subtract a slightly wider peak from the
spectrum to compensate for unstable partials. A gaussian peak could be
tried, or sines with different frequency|amplitude variations could be
analyzed.

Noise very close to the partial would normally not be audible anyways, as
it should be masked.

------------------------------------

== List of plugin tests before releases: ==

1. create SpectMorph CLAP plugin

3. basic ui:
 - do ui elements change color if you move over them without clicking?
 - checkboxes work?
 - sliders work?
 - menus work?
 - can you rename an operator?

4. does the default preset produce sound?

5. switching to 2x2 grid morph using ui preset
 - does mouse interaction work with grid work & sound correctly?

6. load keytrack choir ah/oh preset
 - does key tracking work?
 - do you get visual feedback (grey dots in keytrack operator/grid)
 - does changing control #1 from outside the plugin morph ah <-> oh?

7. create new user defined instrument
 - does set loop range / name / midi note / tuning work?
 - does play work?
 - does play position pointer move properly while playing?
 - does it work in WavSource after saving it?
